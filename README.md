# India Ratings & Research Offers Credit Ratings Services Tailored For Microfinance Institutions

India Ratings and Research, a prominent credit rating agency in India, specializes in providing credit ratings and research services across various sectors, with a specific focus on microfinance institutions (MFIs). Recently, the agency upgraded its outlook on the MFI sector from 'neutral' to 'improving' for FY24, citing anticipated sustained growth momentum and normalization of credit costs.

The MFI sector endured significant challenges during the pandemic, but the agency observes that much of the impact has been absorbed. It foresees a further increase in disbursements, especially after the removal of prescriptive caps on lending rates in March 2022. These regulatory changes are expected to create a more equitable environment for NBFC-MFIs, allowing them to better assess risks and enhance profitability by adjusting pricing accordingly.
